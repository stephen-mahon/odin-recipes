# Odin-Recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project: a free and opensource roadmap to become a developer. The first assignment for the Foundation module is covering the basics of HTML.

Here I am going to demonstrate everything I learned to build a basic recipe website. This is just the HTML, but it's likely I'll be revisiting this site to revamp the website with some CSS.

Somethings I've learned: Boilerplate
HTML boiler plate has always been a bit of a mystery to me. I kind of knew about `<body>` and `<head>`, but not why or how to use the commands correctly in the context of a website. My favourite command has been the BANG command (`!`) to autopopulate the the html document with a basic outline.

In this project I'm going to create a basic list of my favourite foods with link to each page containing the recipe of that food. `index.html` is the landing page, with all the recipes in the `\recipes` folder.

A recipe should contain the following:

1. An image of the finish dish under the h1 heading.
2. A short description of the dish.
3. An **Ingredients** heading with an unordered list of ingredients
4. A **Steps** heading with an ordered list of steps to make to dish.
