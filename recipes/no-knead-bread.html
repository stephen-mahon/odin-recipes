    This bread is sensational. It's the easiest loaf and the most consistent bread I've ever made. It's better than any bread from a supermarket and better than 90% of bakeries out there. It's take a long time to prove, but is worth the wait.

    Serving: 1 loaf <br>
    Preperation time: 5 minutes <br>
    Cook time: 45 minutes <br>
    Idle time: 18 hours <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl using a fork or a wisk. Slowly add the water and mix to form a dough.</li>
        <li>Cover and wait for 18 hours!</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the bowl onto a floured surface. Fold a couple of times to make a seam and make sure the dough is seam-side down. Coat with more flour and cover the dough with a tea towel for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the over to very hot for about 30 minutes. Place a deep ceramic or cast iron pot with a lid in there to preheat, too.</li>
        <li>Dump the bread into the pot seam-side up and put into the oven with covered.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, remove the lid and bake for another 10 - 15 minutes until toasty brown.</li>
        <li>Leave the bread to rest on a wire rack and listen to the bread sing.</li>
    </ol>
